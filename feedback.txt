# Feedback

We're always looking for ways to improve our hiring and trial system,
to get a good balance of challenge and minimal time and frustration.

We'd love some feedback from you on your experience of the trial project.

## Time and Trial Length

> How did you feel about the length of the trial?
> Was it too much, or too quick for the effort involved?


## Complexity or Difficulty

> Did you find the difficulty appropriate?
> Was the trial too easy, too difficult, or just right for the position
> you feel you are applying for?
> (Your answer here is _not_ used to judge you as a candidate, only
>  to improve our trial process)


## Any Other Thoughts?

> There are so many questions we'd love to ask, but we don't want to
> ask for any more of your time. But if you have any other ideas, thoughts,
> or experiences you'd like to share here to help us improve, that would
> be very welcome.


## Thanks!

We want to make things informative, fun, and fast. Hopefully we can get
better with your advice and feedback.
